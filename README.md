# Screenshot Reporter for Protractor
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/protractor-screenshot-reporter.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/protractor-screenshot-reporter)

Use the screenshot reporter to capture screenshots from your [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) nodes after each executed [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) test case.

Use meta data stored as JSON along with the screenshots to create extensive and human readable test reports.

## UNMAINTAINED
This project is currently unmaintained. Please get in contact with me if you would like to take over maintainance and further development of `protractor-screenshot-reporter`.

## Usage
The `protractor-screenshot-reporter` is available via npm:

```bash
$ npm install protractor-screenshot-reporter --save-dev
```

In your Protractor configuration file, register `protractor-screenshot-reporter` in Jasmine:

```javascript
var ScreenShotReporter = require('protractor-screenshot-reporter');

exports.config = {
   // your config here ...

   onPrepare: function() {
      // Add a screenshot reporter and store screenshots to `/tmp/screnshots`:
      jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new ScreenShotReporter({
         baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'
      }));
   }
}
```

## Configuration
### Base Directory (mandatory)
You have to pass a directory path as parameter when creating a new instance of
the screenshot reporter:

```javascript
var reporter = new ScreenShotReporter({
   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'
});
```

If the given directory does not exists, it is created automatically as soon as a screenshot needs to be stored.

### Path Builder (optional)
The function passed as second argument to the constructor is used to build up paths for screenshot files:

```javascript
var path = require('path');

new ScreenShotReporter({
   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'
   , pathBuilder: function pathBuilder(spec, descriptions, results, capabilities) {
      // Return '<browser>/<specname>' as path for screenshots:
      // Example: 'firefox/list-should work'.
      return path.join(capabilities.caps_.browserName, descriptions.join('-'));
   }
});
```
If you omit the path builder, a [GUID](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identifier) is used by default instead.


### Meta Data Builder (optional)
You can modify the contents of the JSON meta data file by passing a function `metaDataBuilder` function as third constructor parameter:

```javascript
new ScreenShotReporter({
   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'
   , metaDataBuilder: function metaDataBuilder(suite, spec, descriptions, results, capabilities) {
      // Return the description of the spec and if it has passed or not:
      return {
         description: descriptions.join(' ')
         , passed: results.passed()
      };
   }
});
```

If you omit the meta data builder, the default implementation is used (see https://github.com/swissmanu/protractor-screenshot-reporter/blob/master/index.js#L42).

### Screenshots for skipped test cases (optional)
Since version 0.0.3, you can define if you want capture screenshots from skipped test cases using the `takeScreenShotsForSkippedSpecs` option:

```javascript
new ScreenShotReporter({
   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'
   , takeScreenShotsForSkippedSpecs: true
});
```

Default is `false`.

### Screenshots only for failed test cases (optional)
Also you can define if you want capture screenshots only from failed test cases using the `takeScreenShotsOnlyForFailedSpecs:` option:

```javascript
new ScreenShotReporter({
   baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'
   , takeScreenShotsOnlyForFailedSpecs: true
});
```

Default is `false`.

## Postprocess Meta Data
A screenshot is saved as PNG image. Along with it, a JSON file with a matching filename is created.

By default, the JSON file contains the test outcome and further information about the Selenium machine which executed the test case:

```json
{
   "description":"index.html header should fail",
   "passed":false,
   "os":"LINUX",
   "browser":{
      "name":"firefox",
      "version":"26.0"
   },
   "screenshot":"004200db-0032-005a-00f3-0072008c001c.png",
   "message":"TypeError: Cannot read property 'be' of undefined",
   "trace":"TypeError: Cannot read property 'be' of undefined\n    at null.<anonymous> etc."
}
```
By parsing these JSON files in a preprocessing step, you can generate a human readable test report.

*Postprocessing is not a functionality of `protractor-screenshot-reporter`. Use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) or similar tools to integrate it into your test process.*
